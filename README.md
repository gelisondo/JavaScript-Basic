# JavaScript-Basic
In this repository you will find many basic examples for coding in the JavaScript language.

This repository is not intended to be a JavaScript course or tutorial, it simply has **.js** files with a brief description in the name about this content, in it you will find JS code with comments to guide the reader what each fraction is about code.

The main idea is to share a quick reference to the language.
